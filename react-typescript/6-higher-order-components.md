# Higher Order Components

Higher order components are generally used to retrieve data from API requests and then pass it into another component.

Convention for Higher Order function is `with<Data>`, where the `<Data>` is the data from the component that is being passed in.

Good way to create the higher order function without the type, and then add it in.
