# Variables & Values

When you use `const` to assign variable, it will assign the value as well as the data type of the value. This is known as literal types

```ts
const age = 6; // this will set age with the data type '6' as well as the value of '6'
```

The above is only possible because numbers are an immutable value type.

## Type Annotation

```ts
let endTime: Date
```

Avoiding this because it can cause the code to get very messy.
